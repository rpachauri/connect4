# Evaluators

An evaluator can be used in Proof Number Search algorithms to determine the Proof Status (Proven, Disproven, Unknown) of a position. For two-player zero-sum games with perfect information, we can use the following definitions:
1. Proven: the player who goes first (Allis (1988) uses Chess's standard of dubbing this player "White" and the opponent "Black") can win the position.
2. Disproven: the player who goes first cannot win the position (i.e. Black can win or draw).
3. Unknown: the position has not yet been proven or disproven.
For a more thorough understanding of Proof Number Search algorithms, see Kishimoto et al (2012).
